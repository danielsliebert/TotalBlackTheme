# TotalBlackTheme

TODO:

- Some content "overflows" causing black bands (eg: facebook bar)0
- Contextual background information missing (eg: Reddit logo)
- Different color on bars and drop down windows
- Hue shift all but images for consistent color theme?
- Improve youtube theme (missing likes and other content)
- RES looks wrong
