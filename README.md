# TotalBlackTheme

Teaching myself CSS by making a global theme. Tested on Linux
with Firefox 54 running compact dark theme. The goal is to run
over the internet with a paintbrush: black out uncessary
information while making important data more vibrant.

- Different color on firefox bars and drop down windows
- Improve youtube theme (missing likes, emojis in description,
        no play bar)
- Improve general color theme
- Volume slider hard to see (facebook, youtube)
- Google docs upper bar hard to read
- https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp white background
- http://www.eastbaytimes.com/ white background
- Improve context menu colors
- Some menus are transparent
- Don't effect pdfs
- Sometimes highlighting blacks out all text
- Some images lost on google maps
