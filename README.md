# TotalBlackTheme

TotalBlackTheme is a userstyle with the goal to run over the internet with a paintbrush: black out unnecessary information while making important data more vibrant. TotalBlackTheme offers many advantages from extending battery life, to lowering cognitive load required to intake excess information, and making important data stand out.

TotalBlackTheme has been tested to work in both FireFox and Chrome browser.
