# TotalBlackTheme

Teaching myself CSS by making a global theme. Tested on Linux
with Firefox 54 running compact dark theme. The goal is to run
over the internet with a paintbrush: black out uncessary
information while making important data more vibrant.

TODO:

- Different color on firefox bars and drop down windows
- Missing icons/images (facebook bar, youtube buttons, google maps
        buttons/images, google upper bar)
- Improve general color theme
- Volume slider hard to see (facebook, youtube)
- Improve context menu colors
- Some menus are transparent
- Sometimes highlighting blacks out all text
- Google docs looks bad
- Optimize speed
- Github colored text
