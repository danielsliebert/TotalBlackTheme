# TotalBlackTheme

Teaching myself CSS by making a global theme. Tested on Linux
with Firefox 54 running compact dark theme.

The goal is to run over the internet with a paintbrush: black
out uncessary information while making important data more
vibrant. I try to retain valuable content like 
buttons/input fields, but sometimes things get covered up.
Global theme downsides ¯\(ツ)/¯

TODO:

- Contextual background information missing (eg: Reddit logo)
- Different color on firefox bars and drop down windows
- Hue shift all but images for consistent color theme?
- Improve youtube theme (missing likes, emojis in description,
        no play bar)
- Improve general color theme
- Volume slider hard to see (facebook, youtube)
- Google docs upper bar hard to read
- https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp white background
- Improve context menu colors
- Amazon hard to read
- Border on drop down menus
- Don't effect pdfs
- Facebook cover photos and photo viewer photos black
- Sometimes highlighting blacks out all text
